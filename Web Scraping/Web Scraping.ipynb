    "# Question 1 - Project to scrape data from the web and store the results in a test or csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High Level Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Receive the content from the CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website and parse the data using lxml parser\n",
    "2. Open a csv file in the write mode and scrape the data with all the html tags in the website\n",
    "3. Use the Yahoo Finance URL, to get the details of each stock with the help of Company abbreviation or symbol.\n",
    "4. Scrape the data and get the values of OPEN price, PREV CLOSE price, VOLUME, MARKET CAP for the each stock.\n",
    "5. Write the scraped contents in the csv file in the format Category, Company symbol, Company Name, OPEN price, PREV CLOSE price, VOLUME, MARKET CAP.\n",
    "6. The program asks for the user's input for the company symbol that the user wants details for.\n",
    "7. Display the contents of the desired stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell containing the program (Alt+Enter).\n",
    "2. Please wait for a minute or two. The list of Most Actives, Gainers and Losers will be displayed.\n",
    "3. Enter the the user input and press Enter.\n",
    "4. Results are displayed."
